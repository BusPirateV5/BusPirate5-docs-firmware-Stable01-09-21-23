There had to be a better way to connect a probe cable to a breadboard or pin header. Something better than probe hooks precariously clipped to the end of jumper wires...

Custom milled pins connect probe cable DuPont-style 2.54mm female crimps to a breadboard or pin header. We designed these little pins after searching for better way to connect to prototype boards and breakout headers, things that just donâ€™t cooperate with probe hooks intended to grab onto IC legs. Made from nickle plated milled copper by a pogo pin manufacturer.
