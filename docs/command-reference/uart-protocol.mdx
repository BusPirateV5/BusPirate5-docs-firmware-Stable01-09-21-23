# UART Protocol Commands

## Overview

-   **Bus:** [UART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_uart),
    [MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface)
    (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter)
-   **Connections:** two pins (RX/TX) and ground
-   **Output type:** 1.2-5volts. Powered by onboard supply or an external voltage on the VOUT/VREF pin
-   **Maximum Voltage:** 5volts

UART is also known as the common PC serial port. The PC serial port
operates at full RS232 voltage levels (-13volts to +13volts) though,
which are not compatible with the Bus Pirate.

## Syntax

|Command| Description  |
|---------|-------|
| [      | Open UART, discard received bytes. |
| {       | Open UART, display data as it arrives asynchronously. |
| \] or } | Close UART.  |
| r       | Check UART for byte, or fail if empty. (r:1…255 for bulk reads) |
| 0b      | Write this binary value. Format is 0b00000000 for a byte, but partial bytes are also fine: 0b1001.|
| 0x      | Write this HEX value. Format is 0x01. Partial bytes are fine: 0xA. A-F can be lower-case or capital letters. |
| 0-255   | Write this decimal value. Any number not preceded by 0x or 0b is interpreted as a decimal value. |
| ```space```| Value delimiter. Use a space to separate numbers. No delimiter is required between non-number values: {0xa6 0 0 16 5 0b111 0xaF rrrr}. |
| \(#\)   | Run macro, (0) for macro list. |

## Macros

### Macro list

|Number|Description|
|-----|---------------------------------|
| 0   | Macro menu                                                                                                 |

<!--

| 1   | Transparent UART bridge. Reset to exit.                                                                    |
| 2   | Live raw UART monitor. Any key exits. [More](http://dangerousprototypes.com/2009/10/19/uart-mode-updates/) |
| 3   | Transparent UART bridge with flow control.                                                                 |

### Transparent UART bridge

UART>(1)**<<<macro 1, transparent UART bridge** UART bridge.
Space continues, anything else exits. Reset to exit. The
transparent UART mode *macro (1)* creates a simple serial->USB bridge.
The only way to exit this mode is to reset the Bus Pirate hardware.

Buffer overrun errors that occur during bridge mode are automatically
cleared so that data continues as normal (firmware v3.0+). The MODE LED
will turn off to alert you of the buffer overrun error.

**Macro (3)** is a second UART bridge mode that includes the CTS and RTS
flow control signals. CTS is on the CS pin (PIC input from external
circuit is passed to FTDI USB->serial chip). RTS is on the CLOCK pin
(PIC output mirrors output from FTDI chip).

Note that the Bus Pirate serial port UART facing the computer (the one
that connects to the USB->serial converter chip and sends text to your
computer) is NOT adjusted to the same speed as the UART bridge. The
USB-side serial port UART will continue to operate at the default
setting (115200bps) unless adjusted with the 'b' menu.

If you use the UART bridge with a computer program that opens the
virtual serial port at a different baud rate, say 9600bps, the exchange
will be garbled because the Bus Pirate expects 115200bps input from the
computer. Adjust the computer-side serial speed first with the 'b' menu,
then start the serial bridge at the desired speed.

### Live UART monitor

UART>(2)**<<<macro 2, UART monitor** Raw UART input. Space to
exit. UART> The UART monitor macro (2) shows a live display of
UART input as raw byte values without any type of formatting. Press any
key to exit the live monitor. This mode works best with a terminal that
can display raw byte values in a variety of formats.

This macro is like the transparent UART macro (1) but without
transmission abilities, and it can be exited with a key press. It’s
useful for monitoring high-speed UART input that causes buffer overrun
errors in other modes.

## MIDI

[MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_Instrument_Digital_Interface)
is a command set used by electronic (music) instruments. It travels over
a standard serial UART configured for 31250bps/8/n/1.

MIDI is a ring network, each node has an input and output socket. Each
node passes messages to the next in the ring. The input and outputs are
opto-isolated. The signaling is at 5volts, 5ma (current-based
signaling). An adapter is required: [example
1](http://www.compuphase.com/electronics/midi_rs232.htm), [example
2](http://www.midi.org/techspecs/electrispec.php).

## Connections
| Bus Pirate | Direction                     | Circuit | Description   |
|------------|--------------------------|---------|---------------|
| TX       | <font size="+2">→</font> | RX    | Bus Pirate Transmit   |
| RX        | <font size="+2">←</font> | TX     | Bus Pirate Receive  |
| GND        | <font size="+2">⏚</font> | GND     | Signal Ground |

Connect the Bus Pirate transmit pin (TX) to the UART device receive
pin (RX). Connect the Bus Pirate receive pin (RX) to the UART
device transmit pin (TX).

<!--

For macros and modes with flow control: CTS is on the CS pin (PIC input
from external circuit is passed to FTDI USB->serial chip). RTS is on the
CLOCK pin (PIC output mirrors output from FTDI chip).
